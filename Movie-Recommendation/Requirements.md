 write a movie recommendation system that takes in uses watch history and ranks them on the basis of actors, popularity score.
 The code has to be extensible

 ---
Clarifying Questions and Assumptions:
- Every Actor has a popularity score. & Users watch history has to contribute to it

 Core Entities:
 - Movie
    - List<Actors>
    - Genre
 - Actor
    - Name
    - popularityScore
 - User
    - name
    - WatchHistory
    - watch() 
 - WatchHistory
    - List<Movies> // can use a stack, if we are interested in something like recently watched or latest n watches.
    - add() // should aggregate metrics like increasing actor's popularity score. (Can we do it like pub-sub?)

 - Recommendation System (Take in popularity score generated by every user's watch history into consideration, but should be extensible, like in future, we may rank by genre. Aim is to provide ranking of movies.)

 Input:
- We take in User's watch history.
